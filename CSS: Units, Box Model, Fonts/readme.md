# CSS: Units, Box Model, Fonts

This project demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS to create a simple webpage that displays an image with a button. The layout is styled to maintain specific spacing requirements and to avoid using certain CSS properties as per the task guidelines.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that defines the document structure.
- **style.css**: The external stylesheet that contains the CSS styling.

## HTML Setup

- The document structure is defined with necessary HTML tags.
- The document title is set and the external stylesheet is linked.

### Body Content

- A `div` element is created for image display with the class `image-container`.
- An image is inserted within the `div`.
- A button for user interaction is added.

## CSS Styling

- The CSS ensures that the `image-container` has equal spacing of **25%** of the screen from the left and right and **10%** from the top and bottom.
- The button is styled with a gradient background and customized font settings.
- Box sizing is used properly to ensure the layout does not cause scrolling.
- Viewport units are used for responsive design.

### Final Steps

- Proper tag closure is ensured in the HTML.
- The project avoids using:
  - Flexbox
  - `overflow: hidden`
  - Positioning properties like `relative` or `absolute`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure both `index.html` and `style.css` are in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the webpage.

## Testing

Make sure to test the webpage in different browsers to ensure functionality and styling are consistent across environments.
